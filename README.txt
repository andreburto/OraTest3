ORATEST3 - Banner/Oracle Table Discovery Tool
----------------------------------------------------------------------

OraTest3 is the successor or OraTest2 (A). It is a tool designed to
make exploring Ellucian Banner(TM) database tables easier for me as
I get used to working with the new system.

Thanks to the Northwest-Schoals Community College (B) IT department
for sharing the queries that got me started on this version of it.

Requirements for OraTest3 are as follows:

* Microsoft .NET 4.0

* Oracle Data Profider for .NET

This software is provided as-is under the MIT License and is not
supported by the developer in any way.
